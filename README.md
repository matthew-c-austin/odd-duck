This application presents a user with a number of strange products. The user is meant to click on their favorite, and the data is recorded. Once the user has chosen their favorite product of the current offerings, a new set of *different* products is shown.

At any point, the user may list out the 'views' and 'clicks' data with the `View Results` button. After a variable number of rounds, the user is able to chart the 'views' and 'clicks' data with the same button.

Data is maintained in local storage using JavaScript's `localstorage` method until the user resets the data with a `Reset` button click.
